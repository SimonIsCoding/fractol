MAKEFILE:
	- Create a correct Makefile that compiles your Libft, your ft_printf and the MACOS MinilibX ✅

You need a function:
1) input/error Management:
	- to control the inputs	=> you have to check if the sets are well written ✅
		- in the case of the julia sets, you can input some numbers that has to be consider as number with decimals (float)✅
			=> you would need a function to convert the ascii to double or float ✅
		=> the numbers puts has to be from -2.0 to 2.0 range ✅
		=> you can also display a message to tell the user that instead of writing './fractol julia', he can add numbers ✅
2) Window Management
	- to exit properly without leaks with escape => without leaks ✅
	- to exit properly when we touch the X at the top left corner => without leaks - EVENT PART ✅
	- we should zoom in and zoom out as much as we want (infinetly) - HOOKS PART ✅ 
	
3) HOOKS Events
	- you have to be able to zoom ✅ 
	- you have to know where the cursor is located in the window => then use these coordonates to zoom in that location (BONUS)❎
	- you have to remap the fractal when we use the arrow ✅ (BONUS)
	- If you touch SHIFT you should manage the iterations management => to maximize the definition ✅ (Not Mandatory) 

4) Fractal Management
	- you have to create the julia's fractal✅ 
		=> and to show the one related to the parameters✅
